### Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using a dataset that includes various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more.

This project demonstrates a full data science workflow from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and insights.

# Dataset
- Kaggle

# Project Objectives

- Understand the key factors that influence housing prices

- Build a predictive model using regression

- Interpret the results and feature importance

- Communicate findings in a business-friendly format

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:

- How do various features (e.g., square footage, neighborhood) correlate with price?

- What are the distributions of key variables?

- Are there outliers or missing values?

- Tools used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Visualizations:

- Distribution of SalePrice

- Correlation heatmap

- Boxplots for categorical features

- Scatter plots for continuous features

üßπ Data Preprocessing

Steps taken:

Handled missing values

Transformed skewed features

One-hot encoded categorical variables

Standardized numerical features

Feature selection (if any)

ü§ñ Model Building

Model(s) used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Train-test split: e.g., 80/20

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤

üß™ Best Model Performance:

R¬≤ Score: 0.87

RMSE: $24,000

(Replace with your actual metrics)

üîç Feature Importance

Key drivers of housing price:

Overall Quality

Total Square Feet

Neighborhood

Garage Area

Use plots (e.g., feature importance from tree-based models or coefficients from regression)

üß† Key Insights

Neighborhood has a strong influence on price, even more than square footage.

House quality ratings correlate more strongly than raw size.

Some features like Pool Area have high variance but low predictive power.
